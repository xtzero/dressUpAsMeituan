# 摘 要

随着互联网的发展，我们身边的商家也纷纷接入了一些互联网平台（例如美团、饿了么等）。这些平台提升了商家的销售效率，也极大地方便了客户与商家间的交流。在“平台”概念成熟之后，美团首次推出了面向每一个商家开放的点餐平台。商家在餐桌上贴二维码，吃饭的人只需要进店扫码即可完成点餐操作，这样既节省了给服务员开支的成本，也大大提升了效率。而后同类产品又继续发展，一些有相关资源的商家有了自家的网店平台。由于是自家投资开发的平台，所以在功能上可以有相对自由又丰富的订制。

本系统基于跨平台开发技术，使用常规的web前端和php后端技术，开发出app客户端和web管理端，组成了一个针对单个商家使用的点餐系统。系统涵盖订单、商家、物品、用户等模块，组成一个完善的点餐+配送闭环。用户在线上完成点单，商家在后台查看订单并进行配送。同时后台提供用户管理功能，商家可以在线下对用户的线上账户进行充值，作为用户的账户储值。

本论文基于此项目，从需求分析、产品设计、功能的编码与实现、系统测试等方面，按照在企业中一个项目的生命周期的顺序进行详细叙述。系统具有科学且严谨的架构，遵循软件工程基本原理，遵循一套详尽的代码格式要求。系统使用前后端分离开发的方式，在最大程度上降低了开发成本与系统复杂性，让一切问题都有迹可循，同时也提高了系统的性能，提高安全性，易于维护和操作。

With the development of the Internet, the businessmen around us have also access to some Internet platforms (such as Mei Tuan, hungry, etc.). These platforms improve the sales efficiency of the merchants and greatly facilitate the communication between customers and merchants. After the concept of "platform" has matured, the delegation first launched an open ordering platform for every business. Businessmen paste two-dimensional codes on the dining table, and diners only need to enter the shop to scan the codes to complete the ordering operation, which not only saves the cost of waiters, but also greatly improves efficiency. Then similar products continue to develop, and some businesses with relevant resources have their own online store platform. Because it is a platform for self-investment and development, it has relatively free and abundant customization in function.



This system is based on cross-platform development technology, using conventional web front-end and PHP back-end technology, develops app client and web management end, and constitutes a ordering system for a single business. The system covers modules such as orders, merchants, goods and users, and forms a perfect ordering + distribution closed-loop. Users complete orders online, and businesses check orders in the background and distribute them. At the same time, the background provides user management function. Businessmen can recharge their online accounts offline as user's account storage value.



This paper is based on this project, from the aspects of requirement analysis, product design, function coding and implementation, system testing and so on, according to the order of the life cycle of a project in an enterprise. The system has a scientific and rigorous architecture, follows the basic principles of software engineering, and follows a set of detailed code format requirements. The system uses the way of front-end and back-end separated development, which reduces the development cost and complexity to the greatest extent, makes all problems follow, and improves the system performance, security, easy maintenance and operation.
